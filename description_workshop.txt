This mod adds in one tile: The Universal Crafter. It's obtainable once you get your hands on some Granite.
It functions as every crafting station you'd reasonably have at any point in the game. For example, you can make Bone Welder recipes after you beat Skeletron.
If you need a station that isn't auto-unlocked, simply right-click the Crafter while holding one, and it'll be added to the list.
If you ever need to know which stations you have unlocked, right-click the orb on top of the Crafter to get a list.

Additional Features:
[list][*]Auto-Unlock Config: You can disable the auto-unlock ability of the Crafter if you find it too cheaty.[*]Mod Support: This mod works with Magic Storage.[/list]
