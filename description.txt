I'm not dead yet!

This mod adds in one tile: The Universal Crafter. Obtainable a little after starting the game, the Crafter will upgrade itself to function as every crafting station in Terraria as you progress. It also works as an Extractinator!

Playing with other mods? No worries! Right-click the base of the Crafter to open up a chest. Any crafting station placed inside will work as normal!
Plus, through <hand-wavy magic explanation>, EVERY Crafter contributes! If you have more than 40 stations you need to add, just place down another Crafter and put them in there!
If you ever forget what all stations you have, right-click the orb and they'll be listed in chat!

As an added bonus, if you're a mod dev, you can add tiles yourself! Check out the homepage for details how!

And before you ask, yes, it works with Magic Storage.

Have fun!
