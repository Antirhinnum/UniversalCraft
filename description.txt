This mod adds in a Universal Crafting Station, which functions as every Crafting Station in Vanilla.

Modded stations can be added using Mod.Call, the parameters of which are listed on the homepage. 
If you have a tile that isn't added, you can right-click the orb on the tile to open up a chest. Any crafting station placed in this chest will be counted in the Crafter.

Changelog: 
v1.7: Reworked mod.
